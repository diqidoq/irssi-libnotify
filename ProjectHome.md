## Old content below ##

A Perl script plugin for irssi that uses D-Bus and libnotify to give desktop users alerts when messages of interest appear.

Read the wiki MainPage for more information on setup and features.

To download this plugin, use the [source code repository](http://code.google.com/p/irssi-libnotify/source/checkout) ('Source' tab).

**USING AN OLD SYSTEM?**:  There is an "old-libnotify" branch that uses `notify-send` to send these messages instead of the newer D-Bus calls.  It is missing some other spiffy features, and will not be maintained further, but may work for you if you are stuck on an older system for some reason. **NOTE:** This obsolete branch is unmaintained, so any bug reports against it will likely be closed.
